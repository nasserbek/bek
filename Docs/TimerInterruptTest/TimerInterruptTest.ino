  The ESP32, ESP32_S2, ESP32_C3 have two timer groups, TIMER_GROUP_0 and TIMER_GROUP_1
  1) each group of ESP32, ESP32_S2 has two general purpose hardware timers, TIMER_0 and TIMER_1
  2) each group of ESP32_C3 has ony one general purpose hardware timer, TIMER_0

  All the timers are based on 64 bits counters and 16 bit prescalers. The timer counters can be configured to count up or down
  and support automatic reload and software reload. They can also generate alarms when they reach a specific value, defined by
  the software. The value of the counter can be read by the software program.

  Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
  unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one ESP32-S2 timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

/*
   Notes:
   Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
   Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
   variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
   the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
   When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
   if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
   If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
   or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.
