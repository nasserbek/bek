The Repository is structured using the following folders.

## Custom Examples

In the folder `01_Common_Nodes` you find tutorials about all the common nodes of Node-Red.
Including the `Inject` and `Debug` node, which are in my opinion the most used node in Node-Red.

Making this node incredibly powerful.
